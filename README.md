## Project Overview

This project aims to provide social media updates based on user interests and preferences. Due to restrictions imposed by Twitter and Meta, the existing scrapers are blocked, and utilizing the Twitter API would incur additional costs.

As an alternative, a `twitter.py` script has been implemented to generate sample data for demonstration purposes. However, please note that this data is not real-time and is provided solely for testing the functionality of the program.

## Usage

Before running the program, ensure that you have the required CSV files containing sample data for demonstration purposes. These CSV files are essential for the program to function correctly.

The program is designed to work with three search categories: Technology, Food, and Travel. Due to the limitations mentioned earlier, new data cannot be scraped from social media sites at this time. However, the provided sample data allows you to explore the functionality of the program effectively.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Place the required CSV files containing sample data in the project directory.
4. Run the program and specify your search preferences.

## Sample Data

This repository contains two CSV files with sample data:

- `demo.csv`: This file contains sample social media data used for testing and demonstration purposes.

- `dates.csv`: This file contains metadata related to the project, including the last update timestamp and other relevant information.


Feel free to explore the contents of these CSV files to understand the structure of the data and how it is utilized within the program.
